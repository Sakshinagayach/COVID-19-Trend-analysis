#COVID-19 Trend Analysis and EDA (India & Global)

# Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 datasets in **India and Worldwide**.  
It analyzes **state-wise and country-wise COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, active cases, and vaccination trends** using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**, along with **Tableau dashboards** for global insights.  

The goal is to uncover meaningful insights such as:
- State-wise impact of COVID-19 in India  
- Recovery & mortality rates  
- Top 10 states by active cases and deaths  
- Vaccination distribution (Male vs Female)  
- Most vaccinated states  
- Growth trends over time  
- **Global COVID-19 spread and comparison across countries** (via Tableau Dashboard)

2. **`covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`** – Vaccination data by state  
3. **Global COVID-19 dataset** – Country-wise COVID-19 cases and deaths (used for Tableau dashboard)
